# Hi, I'm Luiza 👋
I'm a passionate tech enthusiast diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Prompt Engineering. Although I'm still exploring these areas, my journey so far has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. I'm excited to continue learning and expanding my skills in this ever-evolving field.

My interest in technology was sparked back in college at Faculdade Santa Marcelina during an elective graphic design course. Though it was outside my primary field of study, it opened my eyes to the vast world of tech and inspired me to keep learning beyond my original degree. That experience ignited a passion for technology that’s been growing ever since.

## My Journey 🚀
Switching gears and diving into tech has been an exciting adventure. Over the past year, I’ve honed my skills in Python, building a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. As I’ve explored new areas like AI, Machine Learning, and Prompt Engineering, I’ve discovered how much more there is to learn and how these fields can transform the way we solve problems and create solutions.

My diverse background has given me a unique perspective that blends creativity and logic, and I’m eager to apply this approach as I continue my journey in tech. I’m passionate about exploring innovative ways to use technology to make a real difference.

## What's Next? 🌱
I’m currently focused on deepening my knowledge of AI and Machine Learning. I’m excited to dive deeper into the world of algorithms, data analysis, and building intelligent systems. Prompt Engineering has also caught my eye as a way to shape how AI interacts with users and the world around us.

I believe the combination of my Python skills and this expanding knowledge will help me create meaningful solutions and contribute to exciting technological advancements.

## Hobbies 🎮
When I’m not coding, I love relaxing with sitcoms, documentaries, and video games. These activities help me unwind and often spark new ideas that I can bring into my projects.

## Love for Animals 🐾
Outside of tech, I’m a huge animal lover. I have a cat who means the world to me, and she’s even featured in my profile picture, which is a fun AI-generated blend of the two of us. It’s a little reminder of how technology and the things I love can come together in unexpected ways.

## Let’s Connect! 🌐
I’m always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, collaborate on projects, and expand my network. If you’re working on something cool or have resources to share, feel free to reach out—I’d love to learn from you and contribute wherever I can!
