# Hi, I'm Luiza 👋

I'm a passionate Python developer and tech enthusiast. Despite being relatively new to the field, after a year of immersing myself in Python, I've developed a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving.

I am deeply fascinated by the versatility and power of Python, and I'm eager to continue exploring its capabilities and contributing to innovative projects. My journey in Python development has been incredibly rewarding so far, and I look forward to further expanding my skills and knowledge in this exciting field. 

I'm passionate about continuous learning and growth, and I'm eager to start my journey into front-end development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript next.

## My Journey 🚀

Transitioning careers can be challenging, but it's also an opportunity for growth and discovery. I've spent the past year studying Python, improving my skills, and falling in love with the logic and creativity that coding offers. I'm eager to bring my unique perspective to the tech industry and create solutions that make a difference.

## What's Next? 🌱

I'm excited to expand my skill set into front-end development. I believe that a strong understanding of both back-end and front-end technologies can lead to more efficient, effective solutions. I'm looking forward to diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and exploring how these technologies can bring ideas to life on the web.

## Hobbies 🎮

When I'm not coding or learning new technologies, I love to unwind by watching sitcoms and documentaries, and playing video games. These hobbies allow me to relax and recharge, and I often find that they provide unexpected inspiration for my tech projects!

## Passion for Animals 🐾

I'm a huge animal lover, and I have a cat that I adore. I love her so much that my profile picture is AI-generated based on both of us. It's a fun blend of my passion for technology and animals!

## Let's Connect! 🌐

I'm always open to collaborating on projects, learning from others, and expanding my network. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or if you have any resources that could help me on my journey!
